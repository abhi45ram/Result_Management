Before you run the project, make sure to follow these steps:

In the project directory, navigate to the server and client directories and run npm install in each of them. This will install the required Node.js modules for both the server and client sides.

In the client directory, open your terminal and execute npm start to start the development server for the client-side application.

In the server directory, open your terminal and run nodemon index.js to start the server.

Make sure to add your MongoDB connection URL to the .env file for your application. This is essential for your server to connect to the database.

Once everything is set up, the app will run in development mode. You can access it in your web browser by opening http://localhost:3000.
